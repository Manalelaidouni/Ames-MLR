MLR Analysis and Prediction of Ames Real Estate Prices with Streamlit

</h2>

<br>


This interactive app enables you to predict the price of your dream house in the real estate market of Ames, Iowa. Using the user-friendly sidebar prompts on the left, you can input various features and get an estimated house price based on multiple linear regression.

On the right-hand side, you'll find a blog-style write-up that provides a detailed explanation of the analysis and modeling workflow including running statistical multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis on the Ames dataset where we thoroughly examine MLR assumptions and conduct residuals analysis.  

We also explore the geo location data of the houses, which were resourcefully assembled, to uncover further trends and patterns.

Furthermore, we explain the thought-out process of feature selection including the use of AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), adjusted R¬≤ and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) metrics, as well as advanced Machine Learning modeling with Stacking ensemble followed by model interpretation using SHAP. 

You can access the deployed web app on Streamlit Community Cloud at this [link ](https://ames-real-estate.streamlit.app/) üåê.
